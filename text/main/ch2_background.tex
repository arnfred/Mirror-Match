\chapter{Background}

In this chapter we will introduce local feature points in images and 
explain how they work and their applications. First 

Introduction to Computer Vision
 - Introduce common tasks that we are good at that computers aren't
 - Single in on tasks that we can solve using feature points

Introduction to feature points
 - Global explanation of what they are and how they serve to solve the 
problems mentioned before
 - How do we find them? (Examples making it intuitive why corners are 
nice)
 - How do we describe them? (Relate invariance: Light, Rotation, Noise, 
 Scale, \ldots, Affine)
 - Introduce SIFT and explain how the different problems are tackled in 
SIFT)
 - Talk about other methods and how they are different

Matching feature points
 - What applications require matching?
 - How is matching usually done
 - Segue into related work from paper
